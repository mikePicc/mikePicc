- 👋 Hi! I'm Michael and I'm based out of Oakland, CA! 
- 👀 I’m interested in the bleeding edge of technology and how that can affect the lives of everyday people for the better. Specific areas of technology that I love to learn about are AI/ML. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Software Engineering at San Jose State University with a minor in Mathematics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that involve AI/ML or pretty much anything that can be applied to have a better quality of life effect for people!
